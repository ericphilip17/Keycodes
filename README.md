# Keycodes

This is a web page for displaying keycodes for different keyboard keys. 

Once you click a particular key, a pop up comes up with the corresponding keycode and then disappears after 2s. 

Keycodes are useful in implementing certain functionalities on a webpage. Eg, The ENTER key is code 13 and can be used to implement the SUBMIT functionality.
